    <h2>Nameless Sky</h2>
    A small little browser sandbox game similar to that of Minicraft. <br />
    The name is randomly generated, might change it later. <br /><br />

    Until the game starts to resemble something game-worthy, I'll have it on this site.<br />
    But, if you want to play the experimental version of the game, you can try it out 
    <a style="color: #4185d8;" href="https://8s6lj.csb.app/">here</a><br />

    <h2>Farm Galaxy</h2>
    A 3D Stardew Valley-esque farming game that me and a few friends are working on in the Unity Game Engine. <br />
    We're trying to go with a 2D over 3D look, similar to that of Octopath Traveller. <br />
    I don't have much time to work on the game, so no screenshot yet.<br />
    Hopefully I'll have a good example here soon. <br /><br />
